        The best movie I have watched recently was Spider-Man, a superhero and a comic published by Marvel. Spider-Man has various films which may confuse the viewers, but this movie has been animated, which throws into a different plot but has the same concept of a spider biting the protagonist. This is a movie series, and they have already made another movie, but the first one was an introductory, such as getting to know the main characters and the plot. This is a second movie that intertwines with the first. It brought exciting plot twists and mysteries. This movie was terrific and made outstanding details of the art that pictures well with the voice actors and musics into the film.

        <h2>Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse</h2>
        <p>The main character, Miles Morales, was a teenage boy bitten by a radioactive spider while he was with his uncle doing graffiti in a disregarded area. After he got bitten, he realized he had gotten superpowers and started to help individuals in his area. His parents do not know what is going on with him since he hasn't told them, nor does he live with them since he goes to a private school with a dorm. He visits his family sometimes and is an A+ student. Still, he gets too focused on his powers, villains, friends, and other scenarios that take him as Spider-Man. Miles goes through a crisis; as a son and a superhero, he struggles between the two and tries to save his loved ones. This is a mix of part one and part two series that combine each other. Hence, part one was about his powers, and part two was about saving his close ones and what determined him as Spider-Man.</p>
